### 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate software engineer based in Atlanta, GA, currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Georgia State University with a Data Science certificate. My journey spans three countries, five US states, three high schools, and over twenty countries traveled — giving me a global perspective and a knack for adapting to new challenges.

I thrive on building impactful software solutions that make life easier, whether it’s optimizing business workflows, automating tedious tasks, or visualizing data in new ways. My mission? To create tech that’s as intuitive as it is powerful.
